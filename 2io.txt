Map() function takes the input as a <Key,value> pair. In this case, it will read a line, extract only the text values of CityName, Coordinates of a particular customer.
It invokes a function to check the distance with the City's coordinate value. After computing euclidean distance, we decide whether to include it in output of Map() function.
The output of Map() function will be the CustomerID who lies within the given range and the count value being one.

Map: <CustomerID, City> -> List<City, 1>
Example: <CustomerID1, 1>, <CustomerID2, 1>





The Reduce() function will take the output of Map() function where it will collect and count the number of instances of a particular cities.
The final output of Reduce() function will be City Name and sum values of number of instances of CustomerIDs who are within the 5 mile radius.

Reduce: List<City, 1> -> <City, number of customers>
Example: <City1, 10>, <City2, 1>
